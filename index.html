			<p>
				Was it the euphoria I experienced when I broke open my mother's old phone in an attempt to understand its circuits? Or was it the feeling of accomplishment that took hold of me when I wrote my first program? When or where my affinity towards the ever-growing sphere of technology sparked, I'll never know.  But I do know that it ignited within me a flame of passion which has only grown ever since. The seamless integration of hardware into our lives using efficient and intelligent software is something that appeals to me in a way that nothing else does. And thus, while students my age wake up to watch the NBA playoffs; what wakes me on the first ring of the alarm is technology; be it Elon Musk announcing his new solar cell panels, or Google updating its language translation algorithms; if it involves electronics or the software’s that drive them, there’s a small chance I’m not interested.

				Apart from my curricular work, I am also an active debater. My abilities and achievements in this regard were recognized as I was appointed the position of Debate Director in my school. I am also a very frequent participant in Model United Nations conferences, where I have climbed the hierarchy from being a delegate all the way to being the secretary general whilst grabbing multiple awards along the way such as Best Delegate, Honorary Mentions in various regards.
